## What is Funnel Analysis

```
Funnel analysis is a powerful analytics method that shows visually the conversion between the most important steps of the user journey. 
It helps you understand what percent of your users stay with you or churn at a given step. 
Thus every online business can take advantage of it.
```

```
Funnel analysis is typically useful if you want to map out a linear user journey.
```

#### Classic sales funnel:
* STEP 1: Visiting the landing page.
* STEP 2: Browsing through the products.
* STEP 3: Visiting a specific product.
* STEP 4: Adding the specific product to the cart.
* STEP 5: Filling out the purchase form.
* STEP 6: Confirming the order.
* STEP 7: Payment.
* STEP 8: Visiting the “Thank you for your purchase” page.

```
Funnel analysis maps out the experience of the users and you measure their development.

#### The most well-known funnel model: Dave McClure AARRR model
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dave-McClures-Pirate-Metrics.png" width="450" height="306">

It says that a user goes through these typical five steps when using your product or service:

* STEP 1. They land on your website (Acquisition)

* STEP 2. They start using your product (Activation)
* STEP 3. They return to the website/product (Retention)
* STEP 4. They make a purchase (Revenue)
* STEP 5. They refer the page to friends (Referral).

## How to create your first funnel analysis?

* Step 1: Define the steps of your funnel!

* Step 2: Pick the tool you’ll use!

* Step 3: Time for funnel visualization…

I highly recommend using bar charts and nothing else for visualizing funnels!

### How can you get actionable insights from funnel analyses?

#### 1 The first one is the so-called “bottle-neck-check”.
Here you are looking for where most of your users churn.
If you see that during registration everyone provides her name, email address and password, but almost everyone disappears at captcha, 
then you can suspect that there is a problem there (e.g. captcha is not readable).

#### 2 Another metric I like to take a look at is the time-delay between the different funnel steps.
How much time it takes for someone to add a product to her cart, starting from the first visit on the landing page…
This could tell you a lot about your product and your communication as well.

#### 3 The third recommended funnel analysis method is segmentation.

If you can find user-segments who are more successful (have better conversion numbers) at certain steps than others, 
then you instantly have great insights into who to target in the future,
as well as into why other users may have gotten stuck at certain steps.

## Conclusion

* Funnel analysis is a great tool to measure the user journey, the conversion and the development of your users – step by step.
* When you set one up, define 4-8 steps and create a funnel visualization that’s easy to understand!
* Extract insights! Check at which step most people churn, and which segment is the strongest!
