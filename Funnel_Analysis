## What is Funnel Analysis

```
Funnel analysis is a powerful analytics method that shows visually the conversion between the most important steps of the user journey. 
It helps you understand what percent of your users stay with you or churn at a given step. 
Thus every online business can take advantage of it.

Funnel analysis is typically useful if you want to map out a linear user journey.

#### Classic sales funnel:
* STEP 1: Visiting the landing page.
* STEP 2: Browsing through the products.
* STEP 3: Visiting a specific product.
* STEP 4: Adding the specific product to the cart.
* STEP 5: Filling out the purchase form.
* STEP 6: Confirming the order.
* STEP 7: Payment.
* STEP 8: Visiting the “Thank you for your purchase” page.

```
Funnel analysis maps out the experience of the users and you measure their development.
