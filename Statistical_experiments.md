## A-B Testing

```
An A-B test is an experiment with two groups to establish which of two treatments, products, procedures, etc., is superior. 
```
Often, one of the two treatments is the standard existing treatment, or no treatment. 
If a standard (or no) treatment is used, it is called the control. 
A typical hypothesis is that treatment is better than control.
